# Spectral Energy Density (SED) 
SED is the phonon energy spectral density, which is used to analyze the phonon dispersion of materials after MD simulations.<br>

## Usage
```shell
python3 cal_SED.py dev=0/1/2/3 num=10000/20000/30000/..
```
`dev`: the order of derivation of atom position, 1st order means velocity, 2nd order means acceleration....<br>
`num`: the number of steps you will used to calculate the SED, which means the last num MD steps will be adopted. <br>

## Note
This script is used for MS trajectory, thus, you should convert your MS trajectory file (xtd) to reading file (xyz in txt).
You can use the script of `xtd2xyz.pl` which will be found in the internet, and the author is Andrea Minoia.

## Example
Here is an example calculating the Single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNT) SED.<br>
